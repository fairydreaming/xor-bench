Here's how to evaluate the expression:

1. **not x_2:** Since x_2 is True, "not x_2" becomes False.

2. **x_1 xor False:**  x_1 is False. The XOR (^) operation is True only if one of the operands is True and the other is False.  

Therefore, the expression evaluates to **False**.

The output is: '<ANSWER>False</ANSWER>'

Here's how to evaluate the expression:

1. **not x_2:** Since x_2 is False, "not x_2" becomes True.

2. **x_1 xor True:** x_1 is False, and False xor True evaluates to True.


Therefore, the answer is: '<ANSWER>True</ANSWER>'

Here's how to evaluate the expression:

1. **not x_1:** Since x_1 is True, "not x_1" is False.
2. **xor x_2:**  x_2 is False. The XOR (exclusive OR) operation is True only if one of the operands is True and the other is False. Since both operands are False, "xor x_2" is False.
3. **False xor False:** This results in False.


Therefore, the answer is: '<ANSWER>False</ANSWER>'

Here's how to evaluate the expression:

1. **not x_1:** Since x_1 is False, "not x_1" becomes True.
2. **xor x_2:**  We now have True xor True. The XOR (exclusive OR) operator returns True only if one of the operands is True and the other is False. Since both operands are True, the result is False.


Therefore, the final answer is: '<ANSWER>False</ANSWER>'

Here's how to evaluate the expression:

* **not x_1:** Since x_1 is False, not x_1 is True.
* **not x_2:** Since x_2 is True, not x_2 is False.
* **True xor False:** The XOR (exclusive OR) operation returns True if only one of the operands is True. In this case, only one operand is True, so the result is True.
