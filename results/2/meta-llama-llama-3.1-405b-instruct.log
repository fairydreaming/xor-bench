To evaluate the boolean expression x_1 xor x_2, we need to remember the rules for the XOR operation:

- False xor False = False
- False xor True = True
- True xor False = True
- True xor True = False

Given x_1 = False and x_2 = True, we apply the XOR operation:

x_1 xor x_2 = False xor True = True

Therefore, the result of the boolean expression x_1 xor x_2 is True.

<ANSWER>True</ANSWER>

First, evaluate the NOT operation:
not x_2 = not True = False

Then, evaluate the XOR operation:
x_1 xor not x_2 = False xor False = False

Therefore, the final result is:

To evaluate the boolean expression "not x_1 xor not x_2", we first calculate the "not" operations and then the "xor" operation.

1. Calculate "not x_1" and "not x_2":
- not x_1 = not False = True
- not x_2 = not False = True

2. Calculate the "xor" operation between the results of the "not" operations:
- True xor True = False

The "xor" operation between two identical boolean values results in False.

Therefore, the evaluation result of the given boolean expression is False.

To evaluate the boolean expression x_1 xor x_2, we need to understand what "xor" means. "Xor" is short for "exclusive or," which returns True if one and only one of the operands is True. If both operands are the same (either both True or both False), it returns False.

Given:
- x_1 = False
- x_2 = False

Since both x_1 and x_2 are False, according to the definition of "xor," the expression x_1 xor x_2 evaluates to False because both operands are the same.

Therefore, the output is: <ANSWER>False</ANSWER>

To evaluate the boolean expression x_1 xor x_2, we need to understand what the xor operation does. The xor (exclusive or) operation returns True if one and only one of the operands is True. If both operands are True or both are False, it returns False.

Given:
- x_1 = True
- x_2 = True

Since both x_1 and x_2 are True, according to the definition of the xor operation, the result of x_1 xor x_2 is False.

Therefore, the output is: <ANSWER>False</ANSWER>

To evaluate the expression "not x_1 xor not x_2" with the given values of x_1 = False and x_2 = True, we follow these steps:

1. Evaluate "not x_1": Since x_1 is False, "not x_1" becomes True.
2. Evaluate "not x_2": Since x_2 is True, "not x_2" becomes False.
3. Now we have the expression "True xor False".
4. The XOR operation returns True if the two operands are different. In this case, True and False are different.

Therefore, the result of the expression "not x_1 xor not x_2" with the given values is True.

To evaluate the expression "not x_1 xor not x_2" given that x_1 = False and x_2 = False, we follow these steps:

1. Evaluate "not x_1": Since x_1 is False, "not x_1" becomes True.
2. Evaluate "not x_2": Since x_2 is False, "not x_2" becomes True.
3. Evaluate the "xor" operation between the results of "not x_1" and "not x_2": Since both are True, and the "xor" operation returns True only if one of the operands is True and the other is False, the result of "True xor True" is False.

To evaluate the expression "not x_1 xor x_2" given that x_1 = False and x_2 = True, we follow the order of operations which typically places "not" before "xor" in terms of precedence.

1. Evaluate "not x_1": Since x_1 is False, "not x_1" becomes True.
2. Now we have "True xor x_2".
3. Evaluate "xor x_2": Given x_2 is True, we now have "True xor True".

The "xor" (exclusive or) operation returns True if one and only one of the operands is True. If both operands are True or both are False, it returns False.

Therefore, "True xor True" equals False.

The final answer is: <ANSWER>False</ANSWER>.

To evaluate the expression "x_1 xor not x_2", we first need to understand the operations involved:

1. **not** is a unary operation that negates the boolean value. not True = False, not False = True.
2. **xor** (exclusive or) is a binary operation that returns True if one and only one of the operands is True. Otherwise, it returns False.

Given:
- x_1 = True
- x_2 = False

First, evaluate "not x_2":
- not x_2 = not False = True

Then, evaluate "x_1 xor not x_2":
- x_1 xor not x_2 = True xor True = False

Because both operands of the xor operation are True, the result is False.
